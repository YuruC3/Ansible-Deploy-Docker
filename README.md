# Ansible-Deploy-Docker
Simple ansible playbook to deploy latest docker/docker-compose via ansible.

Remember to change <CHANGE_ME>.

Also a bash script that creates a "ansible" user. You'll need to write your public key in script.

It is a good option to create a paswordless ssh key and copy it onto every machine you want to work with.
Bash script is configured to work only with public keys.
